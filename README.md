# Generalized Linear Models: Applied Statistical Modeling in R

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive project on **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)**, developed as part of the MSc in Applied Statistics at the **Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB)**. The project was carried out in the context of the GLMs course and demonstrates applied statistical modeling using **R**.

The primary goal is to showcase how GLMs can effectively answer analytical questions in applied data analysis — especially when the assumptions of classical linear regression do not hold. The project includes models for **binary, count, and continuous response variables**, using appropriate distributions and link functions from the exponential family.

## Objectives

- Understand and apply the theory behind GLMs in real-world data scenarios
- Answer practical statistical questions using GLMs when linear regression is not suitable
- Fit models using different distributions (e.g., binomial, Poisson, Gaussian)
- Apply various link functions: logit, probit, identity, log, etc.
- Interpret coefficients meaningfully within the chosen link function and context
- Assess and compare model performance using AIC, BIC, deviance, and residual analysis
- Produce clear visualizations for fitted models and diagnostics

## Why GLMs?

In many real-world problems, the assumptions of linear regression — such as normally distributed errors and constant variance — are violated. GLMs provide a flexible framework to handle such cases, including:

- **Binary outcomes** (e.g., predicting disease status: yes/no)
- **Count data** (e.g., number of hospital visits, insurance claims)
- **Non-linear relationships** between predictors and the mean response

This project highlights **when and why** GLMs are preferred over simple regression, focusing on model appropriateness, interpretability, and predictive accuracy.
